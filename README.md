# DeathCrystals

DeathCrystals is an inventory management plugin, made specifically for PvP bukkit/spigot servers.

When a player dies, a "crystal" is dropped from his inventory. When right clicked, an inventory is displayed the reveals the inventory of the player that died instead of dropping their items on the ground in a messy fashion. This plugin can be used to prevent lag because less entities are spawned when a player dies.

This is favorable on many servers with lots of players.
